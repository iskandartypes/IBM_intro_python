# IBM_intro_python
Jupyter notebooks for IBM/Cognitive Class's Applied Data Science with Python.

Mostly kept as a sort of public copy of the notebooks I'm currently scribbling in; I reckon I might as well put 'em up.

If you don't know what a notebook is, [they're pretty neat](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html); you can download the Jupyter Notebook App to run them. If you don't want to download or maintain anything, you can use something like [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/doc/jupyter-notebook.html) to run them in browser.
