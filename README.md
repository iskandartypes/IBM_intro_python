# IBM_intro_python
Jupyter notebooks for IBM/Cognitive Class's [Applied Data Science with Python](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/data-science-with-python/). Sorted by class and by topic within that class.

Starts very basic, and not a lot of original code on my end: mostly on GitHub because every single one of the notebooks implores you to post it to GitHub, and I figure I might as well indulge them. Plus, having it handy as a reference might be nice.

If you don't know what a notebook is, [they're pretty neat](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html); you can download the Jupyter Notebook App to run them. If you don't want to download or maintain anything, you can use something like [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/doc/jupyter-notebook.html) to run them in browser.

They'll show up all pretty here, but with my last run-order and not interactive. You can look at the raw if you want the text itself, which is a JSON file.
